# Emoji-Classifier

This project has the goal of:
1. Turning emoji sheet images and metadata into a machine learning data set
2. Experimenting with different types of classifiers used to classify emoji categories
  - Some of the classifiers used include: 
    - Decision Trees
    - Random Forest
    - Logistic Regression
    - SVM
    
3. Identifying good hyperparameters for different classifiers
4. Visualize feature importances
5. Creating a pure-python version of a Decision Tree Classifier, then comparing the prediction speed of the pure-python instance to sklearn's instance
